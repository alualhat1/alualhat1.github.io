### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 2 was enjoyable as I have already been familiar with blackjack which already got my interest. With some already known knowledge of blackjack, I found it cool to code and produce functions of a blackjack game utilizing its scoring system regarding the cards at play. It was also nice way for me to practice what I have learned and apply it to a real-life scenario, in this case, to replicate the scoring of a game of blackjack.

* Lab 9

Lab 9, part 1 was a lab that I found interesting as I found it to be a challenge that would help me demonstrate my skills and what I have learned so far. This lab invovled simply finding the average which was a concept already looked over but with a twist which was to remove the lowest and highest given scores by utilizing new concpets of what I have been learning about throughout the course. It was nice to be able to demonstrate how a simple code written before can be reused to produce something more complex by applying new concepts and practices that are learned.

* Lab 12

Lab 12, part 1 was the last lab of the course and one that I enjoyed as it takes most of the previously learned concepts and applies them into one lab to produce something new that we have not done yet. In this lab, we were assigned to produce a short gif which was just an animation of colors changing on screen using new and old concepts that we have learned. Being able to apply the knowledge gained from this course relating to topics such as 2D arrays, for loops, if statements, and more, to creating something new was something I enjoyed.
